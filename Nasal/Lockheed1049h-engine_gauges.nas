# Nasal code to derive believable engine performance values.eoilt4

# This is a bash to drive the engine temp and oil pressure gauges since
# JSBSIM, in its current incarnation, does not handle large displacement
# piston engines correctly in terms of temperature.  The JSBSIM cylinder 
# head temp will easily go to almost 20,000 degrees if left in full power 
# mode long enough, which is about equal to the surface of the sun.  
# Since oil pressure is calculated through JSBSIM based on RPM and temp., 
# we get negative values for oil pressure through JSBSIM as well. 
#
# Exhaust Gas Temperature stays in believable ranges, so that is what we 
# will use to derive our values from.  We won't get completely accurate
# warm up and cool down effect deriving everything from EGT, but we will
# get reasonably sane values and some time lag can be introduced on the
# estimated cylinder head temp to emulate warm up and cool down.
# Also Exhaust Gas Temp factors ambient air temp into its calculation, so
# it should give some fluctuation with air temp as well.
#
# And since we need to do a calculation in order to drive the torque
# BMEP gauges, we might as well do that here also.
